# Required Libraries for IoT Dashboard with DHT-11 Sensor and MQTT

## Libraries

You can install the required libraries using the commands below:

```bash
# General Raspberry Pi GPIO library
sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio

# Adafruit DHT library for sensor data
sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT

# Flask for web interface
sudo pip3 install Flask

# Paho MQTT for MQTT communication
sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt

# GPIO Zero library (alternative GPIO library)
sudo apt-get install python3-gpiozero

# SMTPLib (included in Python's standard library for email functionality)
```

## Configuration Steps

1. **Verify System and Python Version**:
   Ensure you are running on a Raspberry Pi with Python 3.x installed. Run the following to check the Python version:
   
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. **Enable GPIO**:
   On Raspberry Pi, enable GPIO pins by running `sudo raspi-config`, navigate to `Interface Options`, and enable `GPIO`.

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Run each of the commands above in the terminal to install the required libraries.

4. **Setting Up MQTT Broker (Optional)**:
   If you donâ€™t have an MQTT broker, you can install Mosquitto on the Raspberry Pi as a broker for local MQTT communication:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
   ```

   Start the broker:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
   sudo systemctl start mosquitto
   ```

5. **Running the Flask Application**:
   Run the Flask application with the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 interfaceMQTT.py
   ```

6. **Troubleshooting**:
   If you encounter the "Unknown platform" error with Adafruit_DHT, try installing Python 3.9 or using the `gpiozero` library as an alternative.

7. **Testing Setup**:
   Once configured, you can test the DHT sensor readings and MQTT communication by navigating to the IoT dashboard in a web browser and toggling the LED and fan.

Refer to this guide for additional troubleshooting or library updates as needed.
